Question:
Given an array A of size N of integers.
Your task is to find the sum of minimum and maximum element in the array.

Input:
N = 4
A[]  = {1, 3, 4, 1}

Output:
5 (min=1,max=4,sum=min+max)

class Solution:
    def findSum(self,A,N): 
        #code here
        mi=min(A)
        ma=max(A)
        return(mi+ma)

    n=int(input())
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    ob = Solution()
    print(ob.findSum(a,n))

Thought:
Thought of trying simpler problems to get my mind a rest
will work into difficult problems later, just trying to be consistent :)
