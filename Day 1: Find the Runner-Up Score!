#Question:
#Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, 
#you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given n scores. 
#Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

#input:
#The first line contains n. The second line contains an array A[] of n integers each separated by a space.

#output: 
#Print the runner-up score.

#test case 0:
5
2 3 6 6 5

#desired output:
5

#Code:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = map(int, input().split())
    arr=list(arr)
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    i=max(arr)
    for j in arr:
        if j==i:
            pass
        else:
            print(j)
            break
        
#thoughts:
# i've had a top down approch where i tested each and every step via printing it maybe due to lack of confidance
# although some might argue that using 'pass' and 'break' is not a good practice but in my case it brought me fast results
