1st input is A then N, then contains of A

Input:

4
1 2 3 4
'''
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=input()
c=c.split(" ")
c.reverse()
for i in c:
    print(i,end=" ")
'''
Thoughts:
theres no DS called arry in Python, but list serves in its place
and since its far more flexible than array we do not requitre to use
the 1st to inputs
