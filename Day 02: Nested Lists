Question:
Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, 
store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.
Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

Input:
5
Harry
37.21
Berry
37.21
Tina
37.2
Akriti
41
Harsh

Thoughts:
i did take aid from youtube
although i went on trying Dictonary method but realized the problem is of nested list and thus
aim to improve our control over nested lists
major fault of mine was to not remove the all min scores that were there 
so in previous submission only one copy of last score was being removed
