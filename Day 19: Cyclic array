Question:
Given an array, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Output:
5 1 2 3 4

def rotate( arr, n):

    arr.pop(-1)
    arr.insert(0,x)
    return(arr)

        a = [int(x) for x in input().strip().split()]
        rotate(a, n)
        print(*a)

        T -= 1
