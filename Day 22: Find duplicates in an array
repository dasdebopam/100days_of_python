Question:
Given an array a[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1,
you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array.

Input:
N = 5
a[] = {2,3,1,2,3}

Output:
2 3 
'''
arr.sort()
l=[]
for i in range(1,n-1):
    if arr[i]==arr[i-1]:
        l.append(arr[i])
l=set(l)
for x in l:print(x)
'''
Thought:
Although i was able to nail the problem
there were 2 issues: time and method
i assume its high time for me to study theory
