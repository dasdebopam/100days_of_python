Question:
You need to download 10 files that are sitting at the following specified HTTP urls. You will use the Python package requests to do this work.
You will need to pull the filename from the download uri.
The files are zip files that will also need to be unzipped into their csv format.
They should be downloaded into a folder called downloads which does not exist currently inside the Exercise-1 folder. You should use Python to create the directory, do not do it manually.
Generally, your script should do the following ...
create the directory downloads if it doesn't exist
download the files one by one.
split out the filename from the uri, so the file keeps its original filename.
Each file is a zip, extract the csv from the zip and delete the zip file.

Input:
URLs are given in the code

Output:
The new directory is created!
