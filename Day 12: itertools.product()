Question:
Given two lists A and B find their cartasean Product AxB

Input:
 1 2
 3 4
Output:
(1,3)(1,4)(2,3)(2,4)
'''
import itertools
l=[]

A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
B = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
'''
for i in range(len(A)):
    A[i] = int(A[i])
for i in range(len(B)):
    B[i] = int(B[i])
A=tuple(A)
B=tuple(B)
'''
c=list(itertools.product(A,B))
for i in c:
    print(i,end=" ")
'''
Thoughts:
Need to focus on list comprehension as what i was trying to do(meintioned in quotes)
can be done in a line
